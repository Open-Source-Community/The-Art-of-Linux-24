## Task 4 Submission Guidelines

1. Create a directory named task-4.

2. Inside the `task-4` directory, create a file named `solution.txt`.

3. In `solution.txt`, write the commands used to solve each step. **Do not include the output of the command.**

4. Do not leave blank lines between commands.

5. Upload the `task-4` directory to your tasks GitHub repository using Git on the CLI, **Tasks submitted through GitHub, using GUI will be rejected**.

6. Paste only the command used, don't paste the prompt alongside it


    [osc@osc ~]$ touch newFile # This is not accepted

    touch newFile # This is correct
    

7. Don't paste output of commands unless specified in the task

**Note:** 

- Ensure that the directory and file names are in **lowercase**. Names such as TASK-4, Task-4, task_4, Solution.txt, SOLUTION.TXT, or SoluTION.txt are not acceptable.

6. Change directory to `task_dir` and create a new file named `sample.txt`.

7. Change the permissions of a file named `sample.txt`:

    The `owner`: has `read` and `write` permissions.
    
    The `group`: has `read` permissions.
    
    `Others`: have no permissions.
    
    **Do this using one command**.

8. Change the ownership of `sample.txt` to `newuser`.

9. Change the group ownership of `sample.txt` to `newgroup`.

10. Delete the `newgroup` group.
